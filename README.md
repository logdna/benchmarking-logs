# Benchmarking Logging Formats and Libraries

This repo holds benchmarking experiments for different logging formats and libraries in different languages.

I will be posting up results and further explorations to [my Dev.to account](https://dev.to/nimbinatus) if you want to follow along or understand why I'm doing things the way I am.

This repo is still a work in progress, so things may move around. Also, languages will be added as I get to them.

## Running code yourself

If you would like to run the code in any of the directories, look for a README in that directory with directions.

## Contributing

As this is mainly my own explorations, I don't have a set contribution policy. If you want to add contributions, though, feel free to open an issue or PR :)
